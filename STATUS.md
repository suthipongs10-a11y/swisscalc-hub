# STATUS.md — SwissCalc Hub (calcswiss.ch)

## Current state

**Phase 0 + 0.5 complete. Docs finalized for handoff. M0 is APPROVED to start** (owner decision, 2026-07-12) — the builder may begin M0 immediately; all later milestones still require explicit approval per CLAUDE.md gate rules.

Read order for a fresh session: `CLAUDE.md` → `BUILD_PLAN.md` (current milestone) → `SEO_SPEC.md` → this file. `RESEARCH.md` is the evidence base.

## Decisions (locked)

| Decision | Value | Date |
|---|---|---|
| Domain / brand | **calcswiss.ch** / CalcSwiss (owner registering) | 2026-07-12 |
| Analytics | Cloudflare Web Analytics (cookieless, no banner) | 2026-07-12 |
| Monetization at launch | None — ad-free, no CMP. Ads = future milestone with certified TCF CMP | 2026-07-12 |
| ESTV data posture | Derived parameters + citations + prominent attribution; consent letter drafted at `docs/estv-consent-request.md`, send after M1 Impressum is live | 2026-07-12 |
| Builder | Sessions may run on different models; docs are the contract (see CLAUDE.md) | 2026-07-12 |

## Session log

### 2026-07-12 — Session 1: Phase 0 research + project docs + handoff prep

- Deep research (5 angles, ~58 agents; 10 key claims adversarially verified 3-0) → `RESEARCH.md`.
- Wrote `CLAUDE.md`, `BUILD_PLAN.md`, `STATUS.md`; committed `P0: research + project docs`.
- Owner review: domain calcswiss.ch chosen ($18.98/yr), risk/effort assessment accepted, decision to proceed.
- Handoff prep: added `SEO_SPEC.md` (binding URL map, page anatomies incl. anti-doorway rules for programmatic pages, JSON-LD map, internal-linking topology, technical checklist, indexing/launch checklist, KPI gates, maintenance calendar) and `docs/estv-consent-request.md` (German draft letter + sending protocol). Wired SEO_SPEC tasks into BUILD_PLAN milestones. **M0 approved.**

## Pending / action items

1. **Owner:** register calcswiss.ch; connect to Cloudflare Pages when M0 deploys.
2. **M1:** send ESTV letter (needs `[NAME]`, `[ADRESSE]`, `[E-MAIL]` = Impressum identity); log send date here.
3. **M1:** validate keyword volumes via Google Keyword Planner; append actuals to RESEARCH.md.
4. **Open question (M2):** Quellensteuer tariff-file formats per canton not yet inspected — first task of M2 is a data spike on ZH + GE tariff files before building the tool UI.

## Data-freshness watchlist

| Item | Verify when |
|---|---|
| Säule 3a max deduction (CHF 7'258 was the 2025 value) | At M2 build time, against BSV |
| ESTV 2026 tax data completeness (22/26 cantons live as of research) | Before M3 import |
| BAG premium dataset (next drop ~Sept 2026) | Before premium-finder tool |
| EMBAG open-data transition (may resolve ESTV licensing) | ~Jan 2027 |

## KPI checkpoints (from SEO_SPEC §10)

- M1 + 3 months: brutto-netto page shows GSC impressions.
- M3 + 3 months: ≥13/26 canton pages with impressions; any top-30 ranking for a `steuerrechner [kanton]` term → unlocks municipality/`/fr/` consideration.
